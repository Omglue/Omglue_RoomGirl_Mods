# üìåOmglue's RoomGirl Mods (July 2025)
This repository contains all of my mods for RoomGirl. You can message me in discord for anything really. Join the [Illusion discord server](https://discord.gg/illusionsoft) so discord doesn't block messages (Username: Omblue or Unique: lego_.__)

Here is a list of individual mod folders each with their own readme info text.
- _**If you are a user, these are not downloads but information for individual mods. Continue reading but if you are only looking to download go to [releases](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/releases)**_
- [RoomGirl Extended Save](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/tree/main/src/RG_ExtendedSave) - Needed for mods depending on it
- [RoomGirl Height Mod](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/tree/main/src/RG_HeightMod) - Add a height slider for male characters and in next version will also add a size slider to modify the height without the game stretching your character in some situations.
- RoomGirl Api - In my wish list of mod to make. Equivalent of the KKapi mod making modding much easier.
- RoomGirl Bone Mod - In my wish list too - Add a menu for advanced body and bone customization like [previous game's bone mod](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/ABMX).
- And more i would like to make, or then it dies out and it's sad );

## About modding
Mods from previous illusion game's aren't compatible with this game even if the game code is almost the copy paste due to the choice to use the il2cpp compiler instead of mono compiler. It also made modding 10x more annoying to do since you can't see the code and can't use transpiler patches. There is more info on the [wiki page](https://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Room_Girl/Modding).

Since Illusion [got out of buisnesse](https://x.com/ILLUSION_staff/status/1679660799185555456), modding for this game died because [modders felt](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Illusion/releases#Changelog) like there was no point anymore and so this game almost has no mods which is kind of sad, so since i am a modder I'll try to do some. But I'll be modding other games too so yeah.

## üß∞Valuable info for modding
_**‚ÄºÔ∏èThe rest of this readme text is intended for devs moddind this game, the information and downloads for users can be found in [releases](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/releases)**_.

- Don't forget since this game is compiled with il2cpp, harmony _**transpiler**_ patches can't work.

- Use dnSpy and open the assembly-csharp.dll of Honey Select 2 to look at the decompiled code because it's the closest we have to the code of Room Girl and that isn't compiled with il2cpp.

- Also don't forget to add the [Unity Explorer mod](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) (BepInEx, il2cpp, normal (so not the CoreCLR one)) to help modding and debugging.
