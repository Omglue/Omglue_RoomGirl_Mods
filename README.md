# üìåOmglue's RoomGirl Mods (July 2025)
This repository contains all of my mods for RoomGirl.

Here is a list of individual mod folders each with their own readme info text.
- _**If you are a user, these are not dowloads but informations for individual mods. Continue reading but if you are only looking to download go to [releases](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/releases)**_
- [RoomGirl Extended Save](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/tree/main/src/RG_ExtendedSave) - Needed for mods depending on it
- [RoomGirl Height Mod](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/tree/main/src/RG_HeightMod) - Add a height slidder for male characters
- RoomGirl Api - In my wishlist of mod to make. Equivalent of the KKapi mod making modding much easier.
- And more i would like to make, or then it dies out and it's sad );

## About modding
Mods from previous illusion game game's aren't compatible with this game even if the game code is almost the copy paste due to the choice to use the il2cpp compiler instead of mono compiler. It also made modding 10x more annoying to do since you can't see the code and can't use transpiler patchs. There is more info on the [wiki page](https://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Room_Girl/Modding).

Since Illusion game [got out of buisnesse](https://x.com/ILLUSION_staff/status/1679660799185555456), modding for this game died because [modders felt](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Illusion/releases#Changelog) like there was no point anymore and so this game almost has no mods wich is kind of sad, so since i am a modder i'll try to do some. But i'll be modding other games too so yeah.
