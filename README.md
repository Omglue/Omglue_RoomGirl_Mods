# üìåOmglue's RoomGirl Mods
This repository contains all of my mods for RoomGirl.

## About modding
Mods from previous illusion game game's aren't compatible with this game even if the code is almost the same due to the choice to use the il2cpp compiler instead of mono compiler. It also made modding 10x more annoying to do since you can't see the code and can't use transpiler patchs. There is more info on the [wiki page](https://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Room_Girl/Modding).

Since Illusion game [got out of buisnesse](https://x.com/ILLUSION_staff/status/1679660799185555456), modding for this died because [modders felt](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Illusion/releases#Changelog) like there was no point anymore and so this game almost has no mods wich is kind of sad, so since i am a modder i'll try to do some of it on my own. But i'll be modding other games too so yeah.

**‚ÄºÔ∏èThe rest of this readme text is intended for devs moddind this game, the informations and dowloads for users this can be found in [releases](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/releases)**

If you download this repo to code complete this repo by adding the necessary DLLs in the [RGLibs folder](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/tree/main/src/RGLibs). If you don't know read the [README.md](https://github.com/Omglue/Omglue_RoomGirl_Mods/blob/main/src/RGLibs/README.md) in the folder for instructions.

And don't forget since this game is compiled with il2cpp harmony **transpiler** patchs can't work.
